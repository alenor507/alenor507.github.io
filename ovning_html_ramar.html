        <h1>Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?</h1>
    </strong>
    <i>
        <p1>by William Shakespeare</p1> <br> <br>
    </i>

    <p>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br>
        Thou art more <i>lovely</i> and more <strong>temperate</strong><br>
        Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
        And summer’s lease hath all too short a <sup>date</sup>.</p>

    <p>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, <br>
        And often is his gold complexion <sub>dimm'ds;</sub><br>
        And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
        By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;</p>

    <p>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
        Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,<br>
        Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,<br>
        When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.<br>
        So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br>
        So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
